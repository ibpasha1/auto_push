4314,"Wyeast Liquid Beer Yeast: Brettanomyces Bruxeolensis / 5112"," (BY640-5112) This particular yeast is a wild strain that was collected from the central region of Belgium. It is most often used in addition to a domesticated strain of beer yeast to add a ""sweaty horse blanket"" flavor and aroma to the brew.

4357,"Wyeast Liquid Beer Yeast: Weihenstephen Weizen / 3068","(BY640-3068) This is by far the most popular strain of wheat beer yeast used worldwide. It is a well-loved classic. One of its most distinguishing features is it's banana aroma and notes of clove it adds to the beer. How much of each character can be controlled by fermentation temperature and putting the yeast under stress. Because of these features you can see this yeast strain used in fruit beers as well as wheat beers. It is a top-cropping yeast so you will need to allow plenty of head-space in the fermenter.

Q
Bill (Oostburg, WI)I purchased a PH meter from you so I could check the acid in the wine I make from grapes I grow. The catalog said the meter would come with full instructions, yes it did for operation of the meter, but not what readings I should look for in my wine. Some of the things I have read give the acid content in percentages. Am I right in converting PH readings to percent that PH 7 would be 0%, PH 3.5 would be 50%, and PH 0 would be 100%? What is the best PH reading for wine?


A
CustomerService@ECKraus.comWhen the acid content is given in percentages, it is testing all of the tasteable acids. Whereas the pH tests all of the total acids. Therefore, you cannot convert pH readings into percentages. You are looking for a reading in between 3.8 to 3.4 pH.







Q
Eric (Bent, NM)I was wondering, can your digital pH meter be used to test vinegar?


A
CustomerService@ECKraus.comYes, our digital pH meter will test the pH levels in vinegar.







Q
Sandra (Loveland, CO)I see that the pH meter will test the pH levels in vinegar. Can it also be used on water?


A
CustomerService@ECKraus.comYes, the digital meter will also accurately test the pH levels of water.

4373,"Wine Stabilizer | 3 Oz.","
This Potassium Sorbate, sometimes called &ldquo;Wine Stabilizer&rdquo;, is added to a finished wine before bottling to reduce the possibility of re-fermentation. It is strongly recommended that wine stabilizer be used in any wine you intend to sweeten or any wine that is still sweet after the fermentation is complete. Potassium Sorbate is a yeast growth inhibitor; it will not stop a fermentation that is in progress but it will stop a fermentation from re-starting. Re-fermentation is something that can occur even months after the wine has been bottled. Small amounts of yeast can later become active if bottle temperature and other conditions become right. For best results, use a wine stabilize such as this Potassium Sorbate in combination with either Campden Tablets or Potassium Metabisulfite. Each 3 ounce jar is sufficient for treating between 48 and 96 gallons of wine, depending on the dosage.
Directions: Add the Potasium Sorbate to your wine prior to bottling. First, dissolve it in a small portion of wine, then stir the mixture thoroughly throughout the entire batch.
Dosage: If you do not intend to sweeten your wine, use &frac14; teaspoon per each gallon of wine. If you do intend to sweeten your wine or if the wine tastes sweet, use &frac12; teaspoon per each gallon of wine.
Maximum Dosage: Total dosage should not exceed &frac12; teaspoon per each gallon of wine.
Active Ingredient: Potassium Sorbate (CAS 24634-61-5). Also known as sorbistat-K and Sorbistat Potassium (Formula: C6H7K02)

They supply some of the leading wineries in the Bordeaux and Cognac regions of France. Their hand-crafted barrels are known the world over for their superior quality and velvety aging characteristics.WHAT MAKES THESE BARRELS SO SPECIAL?Only hand-selected, Limousine Oak is used, a wood found in the central forests of France. Limousine Oak is known for its superior, sweet flavor and is in high demand among the French cooperages. The Oak is split, cross-stacked and air-dried for a minimum of 36 months. The wood is then crafted into barrels in the classic French tradition. Staves are hand planed, never sawed. This reduces the release of bitter tannins into the wine from open wood grains. Also, the finished barrel is medium toasted on the inside over an oak wood flame which will help the wine to mature at a faster pace. The result is a barrel with the craftsmanship and quality that can truly raise your wines to higher level of finesse.

4407,"Wine Bottle Sealing Wax"," (SW110) ""Super Adhesion"". Choose one of 7 different colors. Used to create an air-tight seal on corked wine bottles.

Or, dip the entire bottle tip into a pot of melted wax. Each pound is sufficient for 40 to 150 bottles depending on how the wax is used.       Q Jason (Mercer Island, WA)If you are going to wax seal your bottles what is the time period you should do that? I would think you would want your corks to dry out first? Am I correct or should you do it right after corking?   A CustomerService@ECKraus.comYou do not need to wait any time after corking to add the sealing wax.        Q Joyce (Milledgeville, GA)What is the difference in using candle wax as opposed to your sealing wax? Wouldn't the results be the same?   A CustomerService@ECKraus.comActually, candle wax can crack. Our sealing wax has a different, more flexible consistency that molds to the form of the bottle better than candle wax will.        Q Ryan (Loveland, CO)When melting the wax, is there a certain temperature that you should obtain?   A CustomerService@ECKraus.com The temperature that makes the sealing wax the thinnest, therefore best to use is 180 degrees Fahrenheit.

They come in a set of three pads which is sufficient for one 5 gallon filtration, and each pad is approximately 5&rdquo;x5&rdquo; in size. Please choose from these three different coarseness levels: Grade #1 (6 microns): These pads are used mainly for heavy wines. These pads will produce minimal clarity for your wine without loss of body. Grade #2 (1 micron): These pads are used for brightening and polishing your wine. With these pads you should notice a brightness in color and a more brilliant clarity. Grade #3 (.5 micron): These pads are used to remove a very high percentage of the yeast. E.C. Kraus recommends fining your wine with Bentonite or something similar 1 to 2 weeks before filtration. The wine should be passed through grade #2 pads before attempting to filter through grade #3 pads.

4445,"Cellar Craft Showcase: Amarone Wine Kit"," [CSH101] (Ah-ma-ROE-nay) Amarone is a legendary, assertive wine of the Valpolicella area in Italy. Unique and distinctive character comes from the addition of dried grapes during fermentation. The resulting depth is likened to Port or Late Harvest wines but without the sweetness. The wine has a foundation of Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara grapes from the Veneto region. The must is fermented on crushed varietal grapes from over 10 pounds of virgin fruit plus 4 pounds of whole red wine grapes which have been sun-dried to concentrated perfection. A double dose of untoasted oak is used to balance the wine and, with aging, tame the natural tannins. The wine is full-bodied, deep garnet color and richly dry. Notes of plum, sour cherry, raspberry and vanilla gradually marry with anise, bitter chocolate, coffee, tobacco, leather and fig tones that develop with age. Long, lingering finish and alcohol that should exceed 15%. This 18 liter kit makes 6 gallons (30 bottles) of wine. All of the ingredients you will need are included in the kit and are pre-measured along with fool-proof directions. ABOUT CELLAR CRAFT SHOWCASE: Many of these wine kits stand apart from our other offerings and have been deemed worthy of Showcase designation.

4451,"28 Gallon French Oak Barrel","(BL117) ""You'll never find a nicer barrel"". Tonnelleries Allary is a world known French producer of oak barrels. They supply some of the leading wineries in the Bordeaux and Cognac regions of France. Their hand-crafted barrels are known the world over for their superior quality and velvety aging characteristics.WHAT MAKES THESE BARRELS SO SPECIAL?Only hand-selected, Limousine Oak is used, a wood found in the central forests of France. Limousine Oak is known for its superior, sweet flavor and is in high demand among the French cooperages. The Oak is split, cross-stacked and air-dried for a minimum of 36 months. The wood is then crafted into barrels in the classic French tradition. Staves are hand planed, never sawed. This reduces the release of bitter tannins into the wine from open wood grains. Also, the finished barrel is medium toasted on the inside over an oak wood flame which will help the wine to mature at a faster pace. The result is a barrel with the craftsmanship and quality that can truly raise your wines to higher level of finesse.

4460,"Malic Acid"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (AC120) Malic Acid is the primary acid found in fruits such as apples, cherries, peaches and plums. It is typically used in wines that are naturally lacking in acid. Wines too low in acid are flat tasting. Malic Acid adds a liveliness to the wine and helps to bring out it`s fruity flavors. Also, having the proper level of acidity will help to establish a vigorous fermentation. Before you add any acid to a wine you should first check its acid level with pH Strips or a Acid Test Kit. Or, you should be following a reliable recipe.DIRECTIONS:Before Fermentaton: Dissolve the required amount of Malic Acid directly into the wine before the yeast is added. Titration readings taken with an Acid Testing Kit should be about .55%-tartaric for a proper fermentation. Readings taken using pH strips should be about 3.8 to 3.4. One level teaspoon of Malic Acid will raise the acid content of on U.S. gallon by .15%-tartaric.At Bottling Time: Sometimes wines will not taste their best, even when they are at their optimal level of acidity and may require a slight final acid adjustment to taste. This can depend on the wine`s character and your personal taste. To do this, first put measured amounts of Malic Acid, by taste, in a quart sample of your wine. If you add too much to your sample, blend it back into the batch and pull a new sample. Once the dosage is established, add that dose to the entire batch.INGREDIENTS: DL Malic acid (CAS 617-48-1).

4478,"Acid Reducing Crystals"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: [MIN510] Acid Reducing Crystals are used to reduce the amount of acid in a finished wine. Wines too high in acid will typically have a unpleasant tart to sour taste. These wines may also create a burning sensation when being swallowed. Acid Reducing Crystals will help to reduce this sharp taste and unpleasant burning by reducing the amount of acid in the wine to a normal level. It does so by neutralizing the acid and causing it to drop out of the wine in the form of tartrate crystals. The wine is then simply racked off the sediment deposits.DIRECTIONS: Before adding Acid Reducing Crystals to any wine verify with a hydrometer that the fermentation has completed. The wine should be moved off of any sediment into a clean container. Dissolve the Acid Reducing Crystals in a small portion of the wine first. Then stir the mixture thoroughly throughout the rest of the batch. The Acid Reducing Crystals will turn the excess acid into potassium bitartrate crystals (cream of tarter) which will settle out over a period of time. To make sure that none of the settling occurs after your wine has been bottled, it is best to chill your wine to or below 50F. for a 30 day period before bottling. This will give an accelerated opportunity for the crystals to occur. Cooler temperatures require less time, however you do not want to freeze the wine.DOSAGE: For each teaspoon of Acid Reducing Crystals added to 1 gallon of wine, the total acidity (TA) will lower by .18% tartaric. We recommend determining what your wine`s current TA is with an Acid Testing Kit. Then establish a dosage to add to the wine. If you do not have an Acid Testing Kit then use 1/4 teaspoon of Acid Reducing Crystals for every gallon of wine. More Acid Reducing Crystals can be added later if the wine is still too tart.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: Total dosage should not exceed 1-1/4 teaspoon per each gallon of wine.EACH 4 OUNCE JAR: is sufficient for treating between 17 and 82 gallons, depending on the dosage used.ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Potassium bicarbonate (CAS 298-14-6)  ","in stock",New,7.35,eckraus.com/acid-reducing-crystals/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/4478/images/5998/MIN510LG_1__68681.1478552081.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:52:41+00:00,,0.31,,,,,,0,1

The carboy is made out of the same plastic used to make 2 liter soda pop bottles.                                      Q         Dave (Macungie, PA)Does this kit come with a corker?                       A         CustomerService@ECKraus.comNo, it does not come with a corker. The kit comes with mushroom corks that can be put in by hand.                                       Q         Steve (Trinidad, CO)Can I use any of the SunCal juices with the California Connoisseur Kit?                       A         CustomerService@ECKraus.comYou can use the SunCal juice with the equipment that comes in the California Connoisseur Kit for the primary fermentation (the first 5-7 days). After the first racking, you would need to put the SunCal in a smaller container, a 5 gallon carboy or the 6 gallon screw top fermenter. The reason is that there would be too much head/air space in the 9 gallon tuff tanks that come in the California Connoisseur Necessities Box.

A         CustomerService@ECKraus.comYou can use the equipment using your own fruit. You will have to purchase the ingredients separately because the kit only comes with enough ingredients for the one batch of California Connoisseur concentrate. You also may need a different secondary fermenter depending on the size of batches you make.

4521,"Tartaric Acid"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (AC130) Tartaric Acid is the primary acid found in fruits such as grapes, raisins and sultanas. It is typically used in wines that are naturally lacking in acid. Wines too low in acid are flat tasting. Tartaric Acid adds a liveliness to the wine and helps to bring out it`s fruity flavors. Also, having the proper level of acidity will help to establish a vigorous fermentation. Before you add any acid to a wine you should first check its acid level with pH Strips or a Acid Test Kit. Or, you should be following a reliable recipe.DIRECTIONS:Before Fermentaton: Dissolve the required amount of Tartaric Acid directly into the wine before the yeast is added. Titration readings taken with an Acid Testing Kit should be about .55%-tartaric for a proper fermentation. Readings taken using pH strips should be about 3.8 to 3.4. One level teaspoon of Tartaric Acid will raise the acid content of on U.S. gallon by .15%-tartaric.At Bottling Time: Sometimes wines will not taste their best, even when they are at their opimal level of acidity and may require a slight final acid adjustment to taste. This can depend on the wine`s character and your personal taste. To do this, first put measured amounts of Tartaric Acid, by taste, in a quart sample of your wine. If you add too much to your sample, blend it back into the batch and pull a new sample. Once the dosage is established, add that dose to the entire batch.INGREDIENTS: Tartaric acid (CAS 87-69-4).

4535,"4 Oz Plain American Oak Chips"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (WD110) These untoasted American oak chips are designed to give an aging effect to the wine that is very similar to that of a oak barrel. Special care is taken in their preparation. They are naturally air-dried to ""sap clear"" over several years. Untoasted oak chips add structure to a wine by increasing its perceived mouthfeel. This is done through the infusion of the wood`s tannin into the wine. This tannin also help to stabilize the wine`s color and clarity by promoting the falling-out of unstable haze causing proteins.DIRECTIONS: It is recommended that Oak Chips be added to a wine after the fermentation has completed and the wine has had time to cleared. Prepare Oak Chips before using by boiling in water for 15 minutes. Strain the chips off the water and then add the them directly to the wine. Allow the wine to age with the oak chips for 1 to 9 months. Monitor the wine`s flavor throughout the aging process to determine when to remove the oak chips.DOSAGE: The amount of Oak Chips you will want to use varies, but usually it will be in the area of 1 to 2 ounces for every 5 or 6 gallons of wine. The lesser of the amounts should be used in white wines.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: We do not recommend exceeding 4 ounces of oak chips for 5 gallons of wine.

Cherry wood with a small-batch process combine to produce a smoked malt with a lot of smoke flavor, but that is also sweet and smooth. A lot of the bitter compounds normally associated with smoked malts are not there. This allows you to put more smoke into your homebrew, but without worrying about the harshness that can be associated with some smoked malts. Use 1/4 to 1/2 pound to a 5 gallon beer recipe to add complexity to your homebrews. Use a pound or two to add a significant smoke flavor to your homebrew. It is recommended that you do not exceed 60% of the grain bill for making a full-on smoke beer.

4568,"5 Gallon French Oak Barrel"," (BL111) ""You'll never find a nicer barrel"". Tonnelleries Allary is a world known French producer of oak barrels. They supply some of the leading wineries in the Bordeaux and Cognac regions of France. Their hand-crafted barrels are known the world over for their superior quality and velvety aging characteristics.WHAT MAKES THESE BARRELS SO SPECIAL?Only hand-selected, Limousine Oak is used, a wood found in the central forests of France. Limousine Oak is known for its superior, sweet flavor and is in high demand among the French cooperages. The Oak is split, cross-stacked and air-dried for a minimum of 36 months. The wood is then crafted into barrels in the classic French tradition. Staves are hand planed, never sawed. This reduces the release of bitter tannins into the wine from open wood grains. Also, the finished barrel is medium toasted on the inside over an oak wood flame which will help the wine to mature at a faster pace. The result is a barrel with the craftsmanship and quality that can truly raise your wines to higher level of finesse.      Q Liz (Monroe, LA)I would like to know if your 5-gal Barrel has a spigot?

4603,"Brewcraft Beer Recipe Kit / Premium Series: American India Black Ale","
(BCP200) This newer style of beer is similar to the traditional India Pale Ale. There are two essential differences that make it an American-black as opposed to a India Pale. First is the color. It is much darker, almost taking on a coffee color. This is mostly due to the additional infuse of Black Patent malt. Not only does this add to its color, but is also gives the malt profile a slight roasted edge. The second difference is the lowering of the hop bitterness. It still has a lot of hoppiness to offer &mdash; more so than the average homebrew &mdash; but it has been brought back a bit to work in balance with the malt a little more. What you get with these differences is a beer that has an enjoyable, carmel-to-roasted flavor and aroma, with a finish that displays the slightly citrus/floral characters of the hops.
ABOUT BREWCRAFT PREMIUM BEER RECIPE KITS:Each Brewcraft recipe kit contains all the ingredients you need to brew 5 gallons of beer in about 2 weeks. That's over 50 bottles of homebrew!... Brewcraft even throws in the bottle caps. These are ""partial mash"" kits. That means you get the best of both worlds.

4625,"10 Lbs Toasted American Oak Chips","ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (WD125) 10 pound box. These medium-toasted American oak chips are designed to give an aging effect to the wine that is very similar to that of a oak barrel. Special care is taken in their preparation. They are naturally air-dried to ""sap clear"" over several years and then evenly toasted under just the right amount of flame. This helps to concentrate the flavor compounds of the oak and raise them to the surface where they can be more readily infused into the wine. These compounds will soften the wine`s over-all character by adding a coconut texture to it. They will also help to stabilize the wine`s color and clarity by slowly infusing tannins into the wine which will help to drop out unstable haze causing proteins.DIRECTIONS: It is recommended that Oak Chips be added to a wine after the fermentation has completed and the wine has had time to cleared. Prepare Oak Chips before using by boiling in water for 15 minutes. Strain the chips off the water and then add the them directly to the wine. Allow the wine to age with the oak chips for 1 to 9 months. Monitor the wine`s flavor throughout the aging process to determine when to remove the oak chips.DOSAGE: The amount of Oak Chips you will want to use varies, but usually it will be in the area of 1 to 2 ounces for every 5 or 6 gallons of wine. The lesser of the amounts should be used in white wines.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: We do not recommend exceeding 4 ounces of oak chips for 5 gallons of wine.","in stock",New,76.3,eckraus.com/10-lbs-toasted-american-oak-chips/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/4625/images/5845/WD125LG_1__20617.1478552077.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:52:50+00:00,,11.18,,,,,,0,1

Realize that amounts even less then this can change the finish of milder homebrews. If exceeding 20%, it is recommended that rice hulls be added to help reduce the chances of getting a sticky mash. You may also want to consider adding Diataze Enzyme as well if the percentages are higher.

4670,"Speedy Bentonite"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (FIN110) Speedy Bentonite makes the wine clearer, more stable, and more drinkable sooner. Also reduces off-flavors, oxidation and post-bottling sediment. Bentonite is a clay that has the unique ability to remove fine, undesirable particles from a finished wine in a very short period of time. It does so by collecting and dragging these problem particles to the bottom with electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding.MAKING THE SLURRY: Mix 2 tablespoons of Speedy Bentonite with 1 pint of boiling water in a blender. Run blender on high for 3 minutes. Then let the mixture stand for 20 minutes. The slurry is now ready.IF NO BLENDER IS AVAILABLE: Mix 3 tablespoons of Speedy Bentonite with 1 pint of boiling water in a sauce pan. Allow the mixture to cool, then put it in a wine bottle or similar. Shake for 10 minutes and let stand over-night. Shake again before using.USING THE SLURRY: Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the slurry mixture for each gallon of wine. Stir vigorously while adding the slurry. Continue stirring periodically for 30 minutes. Your wine will usually clear in 6 to 12 hours, however it is best to wait several days before bottling the wine to make sure all suspended particles have settled. Once the wine has cleared, siphon it off the sediment into a clean container and it will then be ready to bottle. MAXIMUM DOSAGE: More slurry may be necessary to clear some wines. Additional doses can be added not to exceed 4 tablespoons of slurry mix per gallon of wine.EACH 6 OUNCE JAR: will treat 70 gallons of wine.INGREDIENT: Bentonite (CAS 52623-66-2)  ","in stock",New,7.75,eckraus.com/speedy-bentonite/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/4670/images/6217/fin110lg__94507.1478552087.500.750.jpg?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:52:53+00:00,,0.543,,,,,,0,1

Rather should I say the best way to put them on the bottle. I have tried a hair dryer. That is very slow, and the directions say to boil water and stick the bottle in the water. I can see 30 bottles of wine cracking from the heat. Also, do you sell the ""heat guns"" to heat the capsules to put on the bottles?   A CustomerService@ECKraus.comThe correct way to apply the heat shrinks is to put them on the bottle and secure them with a rubber band. You then dip the end of the bottle, the part with the heat shrink, in boiling water for only a few seconds. The bottle will not crack or break. The end of the bottle will not be in the water for more than a few seconds. A hair dryer will not shrink our heat shrinks well. They will not be smooth and it takes a long time. We do not carry the heat guns.        Q Elmer (Callicoon, NY)What are the heat shrinks made of?   A CustomerService@ECKraus.comThe heat shrinks are made of highly shrinkable PVC plastic.

4719,"Wine Tannin"," (TAN210) Wine Tannin (also known as tannic acid) is very light in color and is preferred by most winemakers to be used with white and rose wines, but it can be used in red wines as well. Tannins are found naturally in fruits such as elderberries, plums and apples. These fruits have sufficient levels of tannin but when it comes to making wine, most fruits lack tannins. Tannins play three distinctive roles in making wine. The first is flavor; tannins increase the zesty flavors that are often left lacking in many homebrewed wines. The literal definition of tannin is the &ldquo;zest&rdquo; or peel of the grape. Tannins aid in the clarification process by neutralizing residual proteins and other proteins, these drop out of suspension by the simple presence of tannins. Tannins also aid in the aging and keeping qualities of wines; wines that are deficient do not take advantage of the aging process very well. Their improvement with time is only marginal and these wines also tend to deteriorate in quality more rapidly in longer storage situations. Each 2 ounce jar is sufficient for treating between 40 and 80 gallons of must, depending on the dosage. Directions: Add the tannin to the must at the beginning of fermentation. Dissolve in a small portion of warm water first and then stir the water mixture evenly throughout the entire batch. Dosage: Add between 1/8 and &frac14; teaspoon of tannin per each gallon of wine. You can also use it as instructed by any recipe you may be using. Each 2-ounce jar will treat between 40 and 80 gallons of must. Ingredients: Tannic Acid (CAS 1401-55-4)  ","in stock",New,9.95,eckraus.com/wine-tannin/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/4719/images/5534/TAN210LG_1__88890.1478552069.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:52:56+00:00,,0.233,,,,,,0,1

4763,"Cellar Craft Showcase: Gruner Veltliner Austrian Wine Kit"," [CSH304] (GROO-nuhr FELT-lee-nuhr) Gruner Veltliner has been grown in Austria since before the Romans conquered the land. It is Austria&rsquo;s indigenous grape variety. Today, at least 2000 years after its first plantings, it is still Austria&rsquo;s most widely planted grape. Like Chardonnay, it is a full-bodied, fruit-driven wine with a big creamy texture, at a much more reasonable price. Additionally, Gru-Vee is never heavily oaked and, as a member of the Traminer c&eacute;page, has an enticing spiciness that makes it perhaps the most versatile food wine in the world. Sommeliers have adopted this &ldquo;new&rdquo; wine as the first recommendation to customers who are looking for the alternative to Chardonnay. Consumers are thrilled with the discovery! Our Gruner Veltliner from the more than 200 year old Huber Estate in the Traisental region will serve as an excellent introduction to this ancient wine. The wine has a green&ndash;yellow hue with complex aromatics reminiscent of apple, pear, grapefruit, honeydew, honeysuckle, banana, and peach. The flavors echo the melon, apple, citrus and peach aromas. The medium-bodied wine shows just a hint of sweetness to balance the natural acidity. The finish lingers pleasantly. This 16 liter kit makes 6 gallons (30 bottles) of wine. All of the ingredients you will need are included in the kit and are pre-measured along with fool-proof directions.ABOUT CELLAR CRAFT SHOWCASE: Many of these wine kits stand apart from our other offerings and have been deemed worthy of Showcase designation. Their distinction may come from breakthrough technology, such as exclusive Crushed Grape Packs; unique regional wines or any wine which we believe reflects a new level of excellence or discovery for the wine hobbyist. The level of excellence may require extra processing steps and, while designed to be bottle-ready in as little as 6 weeks, may require lengthier cellaring time to show at their peak.SPECIAL SAVINGS: Order 2 or more juices in any brand, any combination, at the same time and receive a 10% discount on both of them!

4792,"4 Oz French Toasted Oak Chips","ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (WD150) These medium-toasted French oak chips are used to give an aging effect to the wine that is very similar to that of a French oak barrel. Special care is taken in their preparation. They are naturally air-dried to ""sap clear"" over several years and then evenly toasted under just the right amount of flame. This helps to concentrate the flavor compounds of the oak and raise them to the surface where they can be more readily infused into the wine. These compounds will soften the wine`s over-all character by adding textures ranging from coconut to vanilla. They will also help to stabilize the wine`s color and clarity by slowly infusing tannins into the wine which will help to drop out unstable haze causing proteins.DIRECTIONS: It is recommended that Oak Chips be added to a wine after the fermentation has completed and the wine has had time to cleared. Prepare Oak Chips before using by boiling in water for 15 minutes. Strain the chips off the water and then add the them directly to the wine. Allow the wine to age with the oak chips for 1 to 9 months. Monitor the wine`s flavor throughout the aging process to determine when to remove the oak chips.DOSAGE: The amount of Oak Chips you will want to use varies, but usually it will be in the area of 1 to 2 ounces for every 5 or 6 gallons of wine. The lesser of the amounts should be used in white wines.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: We do not recommend exceeding 4 ounces of oak chips for 5 gallons of wine.

4831,"Yeast Energizer","Yeast Energizer helps to create a more solid and rapid fermentation. It is a blend of nutrients proven best for berry, mead, herb and vegetable wines. The Yeast Energizer will increase the flavor qualities of these wines and also allow you to achieve higher alcohol levels. Yeast Energizer is also ideally suited for re-starting a stuck fermentation. It supplies a source of nutrients found naturally lacking in many fruit and herb wine recipes. Low levels of nutrients usually result in a sluggish fermentation. A wine deficient in nutrients during fermentation can also lead to off-flavors through the production of unwanted fusel oils. Yeast Energizer is similar to Super Ferment or Fermaid. Each 4 ounce jar is sufficient for treating 35-70 gallons of must.  Directions: Add Yeast Energizer by stirring directly into the must until completely dissolved. Dosage: For supplementing a fermentation add ½ teaspoon per gallon of must. For a stuck fermentation add ½ teaspoon per gallon of must. More Yeast Energizer can be added later to a wine for stuck fermentation as needed.  Maximum Dosage: Total dosage should not exceed 1-1/2 teaspoon per each gallon of wine. Ingredients: Diammonium phosphate (CAS 7783-28-0), yeast hulls, magnisum sulphate (CAS 7487-88-9), vitamin B complex, tricalcium phosphate (CAS 1306-06-5).    ","in stock",New,10.85,eckraus.com/yeast-energizer/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/4831/images/5615/NUT210LG_2__89633.1478552071.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:03+00:00,,0.238,,,,,,0,1

4897,"10 Lbs French Toasted Oak Chips","ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (WD155) 10 Pound Box. These medium-toasted French oak chips are used to give an aging effect to the wine that is very similar to that of a French oak barrel. Special care is taken in their preparation. They are naturally air-dried to ""sap clear"" over several years and then evenly toasted under just the right amount of flame. This helps to concentrate the flavor compounds of the oak and raise them to the surface where they can be more readily infused into the wine. These compounds will soften the wine`s over-all character by adding textures ranging from coconut to vanilla. They will also help to stabilize the wine`s color and clarity by slowly infusing tannins into the wine which will help to drop out unstable haze causing proteins.DIRECTIONS: It is recommended that Oak Chips be added to a wine after the fermentation has completed and the wine has had time to cleared. Prepare Oak Chips before using by boiling in water for 15 minutes. Strain the chips off the water and then add the them directly to the wine. Allow the wine to age with the oak chips for 1 to 9 months. Monitor the wine`s flavor throughout the aging process to determine when to remove the oak chips.DOSAGE: The amount of Oak Chips you will want to use varies, but usually it will be in the area of 1 to 2 ounces for every 5 or 6 gallons of wine. The lesser of the amounts should be used in white wines.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: We do not recommend exceeding 4 ounces of oak chips for 5 gallons of wine.

Barrel bung opening is approx 1 1/2"".  Barrel measures approx. 14"" Dia and is approx. 15"" in length.  Each barrel also includes a 1 year warranty against leakage or defects.  WHAT MAKES THESE BARRELS SO SPECIAL?The Hungarian Zemplen oak is the same species as French oak, but this gentle oak, growing in a cooler climate has an even tighter grain.  The trees in the Zemplen Mountains grow much slower which in turns creates a tighter grain which also leads to a more delicate extraction.  Many winemakers enjoy the softer, smoother, creamier texture that Hungarian oak offers.  Up until the early 20th century Hungarian oak barrels were preferred by many French winemakers, but due to wars and supply cuts were forced to find their own sources in France.  The typical flavor character of toasted Hungarian oak is vanilla, sugary, woody, spice and slight carmel like flavors. J K Cooperage of Hungary has been producing high quality barrels for over 75 years.  Their hand-crafted barrels are known the world over for their superior quality and craftsmanship.

4927,"Calcium Carbonate"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: [MIN110] Calcium Carbonate, also known as Precipitated Chalk is used to reduce the amount of acid in a juice or must. Wines too high in acid will typically have a unpleasant tart to sour taste. These wines may also create a burning sensation when being swallowed. Calcium Carbonate will help to reduce this sharp taste and unpleasant burning by lowering the amount of acid in the wine to a normal level. It does so by neutralizing the acid and causing it to drop out of the wine in the form of tiny crystals. The wine is then simply racked off the sediment deposits.DIRECTIONS: Calcium Carbonate is best added to the juice at the beginning of fermentation. Separate one-third of the batch off and thoroughly dissolve the appropriate amount of Calcium Carbonate into it. Then stir the mixture thoroughly throughout the rest of the batch. The more slowly you introduce the Calcium Carbonate to the entire batch, the more effective it will be. Gradually over a 2 hour time frame would be ideal. The Calcium Carbonate will turn the excess acid into calcium tartrate and some calcium malate crystals which will settle out over a period of time. Once the wine has finished, it is recommended that it be bulk aged for several months to make sure that none of the crystals precipitate out after your wine has been bottled. Keep the wine above 60F while bulk aging. Cooler temperatures will slow the precipitation of the acid.DOSAGE: For each teaspoon of Calcium Carbonate added to 1 gallon of wine, the total acidity (TA) will lower by .10% tartaric. We recommend determining what the juice`s current TA is with an Acid Testing Kit. Then establish a dosage to be added to the entire batch. If you do not have an Acid Testing Kit then use 1/2 teaspoon of Calcium Carbonate for every gallon of wine. More Calcium Carbonate can be added later if the wine is still too tart.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: Total dosage should not exceed 3-1/2 teaspoon per each gallon of wine.EACH 5 OUNCE JAR: is sufficient for treating between 18 and 125 gallons, depending on the dosage used.INGREDIENT: Calcium Carbonate (CAS 471-34-1) ","in stock",New,5.85,eckraus.com/calcium-carbonate/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/4927/images/5644/MIN110LG_1__39030.1478552072.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:09+00:00,,0.449,,,,,,0,1

They supply some of the leading wineries in the Bordeaux and Cognac regions of France. Their hand-crafted barrels are known the world over for their superior quality and velvety aging characteristics.WHAT MAKES THESE BARRELS SO SPECIAL?Only hand-selected, Limousine Oak is used, a wood found in the central forests of France. Limousine Oak is known for its superior, sweet flavor and is in high demand among the French cooperages. The Oak is split, cross-stacked and air-dried for a minimum of 36 months. The wood is then crafted into barrels in the classic French tradition. Staves are hand planed, never sawed. This reduces the release of bitter tannins into the wine from open wood grains. Also, the finished barrel is medium toasted on the inside over an oak wood flame which will help the wine to mature at a faster pace. The result is a barrel with the craftsmanship and quality that can truly raise your wines to higher level of finesse.

4957,"Wine Conditioner"," E.C. Kraus&rsquo; wine conditioner (SGR310) reduces harshness in a finished wine by sweetening it to a desired finish. Turn a dry wine into a sweet wine or use just enough wine conditioner to take the dry edge off your wine. This conditioner will reduce any wine&rsquo;s aging time by making it drinkable sooner. It is very convenient and easy to use and comes with complete directions. Directions: Before adding conditioner to any wine verify with a hydrometer that its fermentation is complete. The wine should be clear and moved off of any sediment into a clean container and ready to bottle. Add the Wine Conditioner directly to the wine and don&rsquo;t forget to stir thoroughly to evenly dispense the sugars. Dosage: Wine Conditioner can be added at any dosage to personal taste but be careful not to add too much. You may want to take a measured sample of the wine and add measured amounts of Wine Conditioner to the sample to establish a dosage that is to your liking. This will eliminate any risk of over-sweetening the entire batch. Minimum Dosage: If less than 2 ounces per gallon is used then also add Potassium Sorbate at the rate of &frac14; teaspoon per gallon to eliminate any chance of re-fermentation.

4966,"Crystal 60L: Crisp Malt / 1 lb.","[GN249] Crisp Crystal 60L is a medium-colored crystal malt. It imparts a classic, caramel-sweet flavor and reddish-gold color.

Crystal malts are gently cooked during the malting process.

It works by creating strong negative and positive static charges in the wine, which promotes the clumping and the falling out of yeast, proteins and the break down of haze causing substances. This product is very effective and highly recommended. Each package contains enough to clear 5 or 6 gallons of wine. Directions: Siphon wine off any sediment before beginning. Gently stir into the wine the contents of packet #1 (on the left), and then gently stir in the contents of packet #2 (on the right). Continue to stir the wine until both ingredients are evenly dispersed throughout the wine. Allow the wine to clear for 3 to 5 days. Once wine has cleared, siphon off the rest of the sediment and it will then be ready to bottle.

It`s perfect for situations where a fermenter`s head-space is limited. Handy to have around. It`s very simple to use.

This layer acts like a cap that keeps bubbles from forming. Instant Antifoam is a food-grade product and is perfectly safe to use on any type of liquid.DIRECTIONS: Add Instant Antifoam directly to the surface. There is no need to stir it into the wine. Instant Antifoam is most effective when it is added before any foaming occurs, but it can be added later if foaming unexpectedly becomes an issue.DOSAGE: Use 1/4 teaspoon for each 5 or 6 gallons of wine, or use 2 to 4 drops per each gallon.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: Total dosage should not exceed 1/2 teaspoon to each 6 gallons of wine or 8 drop per gallon.EACH 1 OUNCE BOTTLE: is sufficient for treating between 72 and 144 gallons of wine depending on the dosage used.INGREDIENTS: FG-10 (Dimethylpolysiloxane silica, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, stearate emulsifier, alginate emulsifier, and water)  ","in stock",New,8.7,eckraus.com/instant-anti-foam/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5042/images/6895/FM210LG_1__83304.1478552103.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:17+00:00,,0.113,,,,,,0,1

(BCU160) This is a strong beer with a beautiful, illuminating, yellow color. The arching impression it gives is one of complexity brought about by layers of estery flavors and aromas. These qualities are the result of a hard and complete fermentation that this beer goes through. The medoly of flavors and aromas include banana, tropical fruit, some citrus, among others, and a touch of spice at the end. The maltiness of this beer is low &mdash; especially when you consider the amount of alcohol it contains. This is because of the Belgian candy that is used along with the malt. This raises the alcohol without intensifying the malt flavor. The hops have a medium bitterness that are in complete balance with the deceptively light character of this beer.

5069,"Acidulated (Sour) Malt: Weyermann / 1 lb.","[GN221] Acidulated malt was traditionally used to adjust mash pH in cities with extremely alkaline water. However, the lactic acid used also contributes its own distinctive flavor to the beer when used in significant amounts. Over about 10% of the mash, it becomes more difficult to work with. Using Acidulated malt will result in a better working mash with well-rounded beer flavors. Weyermann Malting produces an Acidulated malt designed to adjust the pH level in mash or wort. Weyermann recommends using the following formula to calculate the dosage of Acidulated malt: use 1% of Acidulated malt to reduce the pH by 0.1. (Example: 3% Acidulated malt reduce the pH in mash by 0.3). However, this is an estimate as the exact effect depends on the special conditions in the mash or wort (buffering capacity) and on the composition of the brew water. Weyermann produces their Acidulated malt by using lactic acid, which is generated by natural occurring lactic bacteria on the grain. This allows Acidulated malt to be used to produce beer styles with a typical sour character like a Berliner Weisse. &nbsp;   Grain Type: Base Malt Approximate Lovibond: 1.7 - 2.8 EBC 3.0 - 6.0 Usage Rate up to 5% Origin: German  &nbsp; Special Savings:&nbsp;Buy 10 or more bags of malt - any type, any brand - and save 10% on them.

And for you homebrewers, it handles temperatures up to 127&deg;F.  The FerMonster is made of brilliantly clear P.E.T. that is colorless, odorless and stain-resistant. This is the same material used to make 2 liter soda bottle, only thicker P.E.T. is an oxygen-barrier plastic that will not let air pass through.

5173,"Ascorbic Acid"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (AC210) Ascorbic Acid, also called Anti-Oxidant, can be added to a wine at bottling time to help protect it`s color from oxidative effects such as browning and spoilage. Ascorbic Acid is highly recommended for wines that discolor easily such as apple or pear. It is also recommended for white wines where a slight discoloration can be easily detected, such as the case with many lighter white wines.

Adding Gypsum to your Sherry will help emulate the characteristics that are present in these wines.DIRECTIONS: When making beer, introduce the Gypsum into a brewing mash while heating it up. When making Sherry, add it to the must before fermentation. Thoroughly dissolve the Gypsum into a small portion of the wine first, then slowly blend the mixture in the entire batch.DOSAGE: When making beer, the recommend dosage is 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons, or use the amount called for by any beer recipe you may be using. When making Sherry, the recommended dosage is 1-1/2 teaspoon per gallon, or use the amount called for by any Sherry recipe you may be using.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: Total dosage should not exceed 1/2 teaspoons for each gallon of beer or 4 teaspoons for each gallon of Sherry.EACH 4 OUNCE JAR: is sufficient for treating either 250 gallons of beer or 33 gallons of Sherry.INGREDIENT: Calcium sulfate (CAS 7778-18-9) ","in stock",New,5.2,eckraus.com/calcium-sulfate-gypsum-purified/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5238/images/5840/min210lg__28755.1478552077.500.750.jpg?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:32+00:00,,0.33,,,,,,0,1

5269,"Citric Acid","ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (AC110) Citric Acid is the primary acid found in fruits such as oranges, lemons and pineapples. It is typically used in wines that are naturally lacking in acid. Wines too low in acid are flat tasting. Citric Acid adds a liveliness to the wine and helps to bring out it`s fruity flavors. Also, having the proper level of acidity will help to establish a vigorous fermentation. Before you add any acid to a wine you should first check its acid level with pH Strips or a Acid Test Kit. Or, you should be following a reliable recipe.DIRECTIONS:Before Fermentaton: Dissolve the required amount of Citric Acid directly into the wine before the yeast is added. Titration readings taken with an Acid Testing Kit should be about .55%-tartaric for a proper fermentation. Readings taken using pH strips should be about 3.8 to 3.4. One level teaspoon of Citric Acid will raise the acid content of on U.S. gallon by .15%-tartaric.At Bottling Time: Sometimes wines will not taste their best, even when they are at their opimal level of acidity and may require a slight final acid adjustment to taste. This can depend on the wine`s character and your personal taste. To do this, first put measured amounts of Citric Acid, by taste, in a quart sample of your wine. If you add too much to your sample, blend it back into the batch and pull a new sample. Once the dosage is established, add that dose to the entire batch.INGREDIENTS: Citric acid, anhydrous (CAS 77-92-9).","in stock",New,8.35,eckraus.com/citric-acid/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5269/images/5563/AC110LG_1__44504.1478552069.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:34+00:00,,0.519,,,,,,0,1

5287,"Brewcraft Beer Recipe Kit / Ultimate Series: Oak Barrel Imperial IPA","
(BCU170) This homebrew is primarily a bulked-up take on an American-style IPA. It could be called a Double IPA. It has a lot of hops, a lot of malt, and a lot of alcohol! It is a very even tasting beer for an IPA. It is smooth with some clean, crisp impressions. The hops are predominant and layered, as they should be. Along with their hefty bitterness, the hops add citrus flavors and aromas ranging from limes to tropical fruit. This brew has an intense, deep golden color with some full maltiness to match. Additional complexity comes from the addition of an oak wood spirals that adds some toasty vanilla notes to this big brew.

5307,"Mangrove Jack's: Craft Series Beer Yeast","
These 9 strains of craft beer yeast have been isolated, propagated and dried using state of the art manufacturing facilities to give you correct pitching counts, superior shelf stability, and ease of use. They are packaged in 10 gram sachets and are sufficient for making up to 6 gallons of homebrew.
&nbsp;
Choose From:

Bohemian Lager / M84: This is a classic bottom-fermenting, continental lager strain that produces elegant, well balanced beers. Bohemian Lager Yeast is characterized by its dry and clean palate, typical of traditional Czech brewing. This strain confers smooth, subtle yeast characteristics with muted fruit notes, resulting in refreshingly crisp lagers with expressive hop character. While rich and chewy, the beers fermented with this strain will not be sweet, but may have an elusive sweet malt flavor in the aftertaste. Lagering periods as short as 4 weeks may produce acceptable beer, but allowing beer to lager 6-8 weeks will result in beer that is richer, smoother, with a more refined aroma and flavor.
US West Coast / M44: There has been a demand for a yeast strain which emphasizes the expressive flavors of the unique ingredients used. U.S. West Coast Yeast is a high attenuating, top-fermenting strain that ferments with almost completely neutral attributes across a wide range of wort strengths and temperature ranges. It produces a moderately high acidity which allows the tangy citrus hop aromas to really punch through, while also enhancing toasted and dark malt characters. If you plan to use a lot of expensive flavorful hops as the prominent feature of your beer, use this yeast.
Liberty Bell Ale / M36: A top fermenting ale yeast suitable for a wide variety of hoppy and distinctive style beers. This strain produces light, delicate fruity esters and helps to develop malt character. Suitable for both English and American Pale Ales, Extra Special Bitters, Golden Ales and more. Good for up to 6 gallons.
Newcastle Dark Ale / M03: This yeast successfully brings classic cask ale production into the homebrew or craft setting. This is a top-fermentation strain well suited for fermenting British ales, particularly dark and full bodied ales, mild brown ales and Scottish Heavy ales. Selected to not over attenuate, this strain will stop short of the low end gravities exhibited by other yeast strains. Dark fruity esters are pronounced when fermented at the appropriate temperature. Care should be taken to adjust hop bitterness to ensures it suits the ester character and complements the fuller bodied finish.
Belgian Tripel / M31: Provides a fantastic complex marriage of spice, fruity esters, phenolics and alcohol. It is also very attenuative with a high alcohol tolerance making it perfect for a range of Belgian styles. Suitable for Belgian Tripel and Trappist style beers.
Bavarian Wheat / M20: A classic top-fermenting yeast suited for brewing a range of German Weizens as well as Belgian Witbier. It has a very low flocculation rate and a clean, &ldquo;yeasty&rdquo; aroma which makes it ideal for beers that are traditionally served cloudy. This yeast creates beer with a low to completely dry level of sweetness, medium body with a silky mouth feel, and a delicious banana and spice aroma.
Cider / M02: Mangrove Jack&rsquo;s Cider Yeast is a high ester-producing strain, imparting wonderful flavor depth, revealing the full fruit potential of the juice. Ciders fermented using this strain are exceptionally crisp, flavorsome and refreshing in taste. This highly robust yeast has good fructose assimilation and is capable of fermenting under challenging conditions and over a wide temperature range. Mangrove Jack&rsquo;s Cider Yeast is a highly flocculent strain, suitable for all styles of cider. Trace nutrients have been blended with the yeast in Mangrove Jack&rsquo;s Cider Yeast sachets for optimum yeast health, fermentation performance and cider quality.

5331,"Acid Blend"," This product (AC190) is a blend of the three most common acids around in fruit: citric, malic and tartaric. It&rsquo;s typically used in wines that are naturally lacking in acid, which typically results in a flat tasting wine. Acid Blend adds liveliness to the wine and helps to bring out its fruity flavors. Having a proper level of acidity will help establish a vigorous fermentation. Before you add any acid to a wine you should first check its acid level with pH strips or an acid test kit. Directions: Before Fermentation: Dissolve the required amount of Acid Blend directly into the wine before the yeast is added. Titration readings taken with an Acid Testing Kit should be about .55% tartaric for a proper fermentation. Readings taken using pH strips should be about 3.8-3.4. One level teaspoon of Acid Blend will raise the acid content of one U.S. gallon by .15% tartaric. At Bottling Time:  Sometimes wines will not taste their best, even when they are at their optimal level of acidity and may require a slight final acid adjustment to taste. This also depends on the wine&rsquo;s character and your personal taste. To accomplish this, first, put measured amounts of Acid Blend, in a quart sized sample of your wine.

Crystal malts also add body and improve head retention. This light crystal is best used in lighter-colored beers where it adds maltiness and improves mouth feel with minimal alteration of color. Crystal malts are gently cooked during the malting process. Cooking initiates the enzymatic conversion of starches into fermentable sugars, and caramelizes some of the sugars as the malt reaches its final color. This eliminates the need to mash crystal malt, and ensures that some of the sugars will survive fermentation to sweeten the beer. &nbsp;   Grain Type: Crystal/Carmel Malt Approximate Lovibond: 13.0 - 20.0 EBC 33.0 - 52.0 Usage Rate up to 20% Origin: England  &nbsp; Special Savings:&nbsp;Buy 10 or more bags of malt - any type, any brand - and save 10% on them.

5423,"Natural Grape Tannin"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (TAN110) Also known as tannic acid. This tannin is redish-brown and preferred by most winemakers for adding to red wines. Tannins are found naturally in fruits. Elderberries, plums, apples and others have sufficient levels of tannin, however when it comes to making wine, most fruits are lacking in tannins. Tannins play three distinctive roles in making wine. The first is flavor. Tannins increase the zesty flavors that is often lacking in many home wines. Quite literally tannin is the ""zest"" or peel of the grape. Tannins aid in the clarification process. Residual proteins and other particles are neutralized and dropped out of suspension by its presence. Tannins also aid in the aging and keeping qualities of the wine. Wines that are deficient in tannin do not take advantage of the aging process very well. Their improvement with time is only marginal. These wines also tend to deteriorate in quality more rapidly in longer storage situations.DIRECTIONS: Add the tannin to the must at the begining of fermentation. Dissolve in a small portion of warm water first. Then stir the water mixture evenly throughout the entire batch.DOSAGE: Add between 1/8 and 1/4 teaspoon of tannin per each gallon of wine. Or, use as instructed by any recipe you may be using.EACH 2 OUNCE JAR: is sufficient for treating between 40 and 80 gallons of must, depending on the dosage.INGREDIENTS: Tannic acid (CAS 1401-55-4) ","in stock",New,8.65,eckraus.com/natural-grape-tannin/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5423/images/5628/TAN110LG_1__16267.1478552071.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:47+00:00,,0.233,,,,,,0,1

5426,"Diatase Enzyme"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (ENZ210) Diatase Enzyme converts starches and other complex carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. It can be used in either wine or beer, and in mashes that are to be distilled. It is also known as amylase, diataze, diazyme, diastatic enzyme and glucoamylase. Comes with detailed directions.USE IN WINE: Starch can sometimes be a problem for certain types of wines. If all the starches are not converted into sugar during the fermentation the wine can end up having a permanent ""starch haze"". When making wine from fruits, the amount of starch is very minimal and can easily be converted into sugars by the yeast with no additional help, but when making wines from vegetables, grains and other such produce, starches can be an issue. For these wines 1/2 teaspoon of Diatase Enzyme should be added at the beginning of fermentation for every pound of starchy ingredient used.USE IN BEER: Most beer recipes do not require the addition of Diatase Enzyme. This is because there is enough diastatic enzymes naturally in the recipe from base malted barleys such as Two Row and Six Row. A situation where Diatase would be beneficial is when significant amounts of starchy adjuncts are being used such as specialty barley grains, oats, rye, rice, corn, etc. and no base barley is being used. In these type of recipes 1/2 teaspoon of Diatase Enzyme should be added during the mashing process. The mash should be held at 140F. to 150F. for 45 minutes.USE IN DISTILLING: When distilling a mash, the intention is to ferment as much alcohol as possible out of each pound of grain. Diatase Enzyme will aid this process by turning all the starches into alcohol producing sugars. For each pound of grain stir in 1/2 teaspoon of diatase at the beginning of fermentation.EACH 2 OUNCE BOTTLE: is sufficient for treating 24 pounds of starchy ingredients.INGREDIENTS: Alpha-amylase (CAS 9000-90-2) and beta-amylase (CAS 9000-91-3)  ","in stock",New,8.3,eckraus.com/diatase-enzyme/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5426/images/6791/ENZ210LG_1__81450.1478552100.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:47+00:00,,0.233,,,,,,0,1

5428,"4 Oz Toasted American Oak Chips","ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (WD120) These medium-toasted American oak chips are used to give an aging effect to the wine that is very similar to that of a oak barrel. Special care is taken in their preparation. They are naturally air-dried to ""sap clear"" over several years and then evenly toasted under just the right amount of flame. This helps to concentrate the flavor compounds of the oak and raise them to the surface where they can be more readily infused into the wine. These compounds will soften the wine`s over-all character by adding a coconut texture to it. They will also help to stabilize the wine`s color and clarity by slowly infusing tannins into the wine which will help to drop out unstable haze causing proteins.DIRECTIONS: It is recommended that Oak Chips be added to a wine after the fermentation has completed and the wine has had time to cleared.

The vineyards have high calcium carbonate content in their soil. This imparts a distinctive chalkiness which combines with the powerful dark fruit qualities of the grape to create the big, chewy mouth-feel that is a clear signature of Red Mountain Cabernet. Another distinction is a hint of orange peel aromatics and flavors. Together these two traits make Red Mountain Cabernet immediately recognizable, highly prized, and much sought after. This 18 liter kit makes 6 gallons (30 bottles) of wine. All of the ingredients you will need are included in the kit and are pre-measured along with fool-proof directions.ABOUT CELLAR CRAFT SHOWCASE: Many of these wine kits stand apart from our other offerings and have been deemed worthy of Showcase designation. Their distinction may come from breakthrough technology, such as exclusive Crushed Grape Packs; unique regional wines or any wine which we believe reflects a new level of excellence or discovery for the wine hobbyist. The level of excellence may require extra processing steps and, while designed to be bottle-ready in as little as 6 weeks, may require lengthier cellaring time to show at their peak.SPECIAL SAVINGS: Order 2 or more juices in any brand, any combination, at the same time and receive a 10% discount on both of them!

5467,"Organic Yeast Nutrient","ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (NUT220) Organic Yeast Nutrient increases the supply of nitrogen to the yeast in the form of natural proteins. This increases the yeast`s ability to ferment faster and more complete. It is most effective in wines where the juice has been cut with water or in lighter beers where the malt has been cut with sugar or rice. Beers made from malt extract, as opposed to all-grain, tend to benefit more from its addition. Nitrogen is naturally lacking in most fermentations. Low levels of nitrogen usually results in a sluggish fermentation. A wine or beer that is deficient in nitrogen during fermentation can also produce off-flavors through the production of unwanted fusel oils.DIRECTIONS: Add Brewer's Yeast Nutrient prior to fermentation by stirring directly into the wine must or beer wort until completely dissolved.DOSAGE: For wine add 1 teaspoon per gallon. For beer add 1 teaspoon for each 3 gallons. More Brewer's Yeast Nutrient can be added later for stuck fermentation as needed. Each 4 ounce jar is sufficient for treating either 40 gallons of wine or 120 gallons of beer.","out of stock",New,6.95,eckraus.com/organic-yeast-nutrient/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5467/images/6468/NUT220LG_1__08532.1478552093.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:51+00:00,,0.407,,,,,,0,1

5469,"Magnetic Stir Plate","(LAB510) Stir plates are the best way to maximize yeast growth when making starters. With constant agitation, yeast cell contact with the wort is maximized, improving sugar and nutrient uptake to allow for more rapid growth. Any carbon dioxide is driven out of solution resulting in less stress on the yeast, and oxygen is continually available to allow for optimum cell membrane synthesis which means healthier yeast.  Starters made with the stirring method are ready faster and typically contain a much larger cell count then standard starter methods. Stir bar is included.  Overall surface dimensions are 4"" x 6"".  Glass Flask is sold separately.

Part one is a book in itself focused solely on home brewing ingredients and techniques, including 3 chapters on hops alone.

Instead, he complements this emphasis on data with creative use of graphics where one could get bogged down in the stats, there is usually a clear visual depiction to instantly summarize their meaning. Part 2 is an indispensable guide intended for brewers interested in formulating their own beers based on classic styles, modern techniques, and their own vision of the perfect beer.

5488,"10 Lbs Plain American Oak Chips","ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: (WD115) 10 pound box. These untoasted American oak chips are designed to give an aging effect to the wine that is very similar to that of a oak barrel. Special care is taken in their preparation. They are naturally air-dried to ""sap clear"" over several years. Untoasted oak chips add structure to a wine by increasing its perceived mouthfeel. This is done through the infusion of the wood`s tannin into the wine. This tannin also help to stabilize the wine`s color and clarity by promoting the falling-out of unstable haze causing proteins.DIRECTIONS: It is recommended that Oak Chips be added to a wine after the fermentation has completed and the wine has had time to cleared. Prepare Oak Chips before using by boiling in water for 15 minutes. Strain the chips off the water and then add the them directly to the wine. Allow the wine to age with the oak chips for 1 to 9 months. Monitor the wine`s flavor throughout the aging process to determine when to remove the oak chips.DOSAGE: The amount of Oak Chips you will want to use varies, but usually it will be in the area of 1 to 2 ounces for every 5 or 6 gallons of wine. The lesser of the amounts should be used in white wines.MAXIMUM DOSAGE: We do not recommend exceeding 4 ounces of oak chips for 5 gallons of wine.","in stock",New,72.9,eckraus.com/10-lbs-plain-american-oak-chips/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5488/images/5919/WD115LG_1__58758.1478552079.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:52+00:00,,11.18,,,,,,0,1
5489,"Cellar Craft Showcase: Shiraz South African Wine Kit"," [CSH111] (Shee-rahz) This Shiraz from South Africa&rsquo;s Stellenbosch region continues to gain international recognition for its distinctive new style. It may best be described as having Rhone-style backbone but with heady, New-World, up-front fruit. It is however more refined than many Australian &ldquo;fruit bombs&rdquo;. Fermentation on a Crushed Grape Pack of Stellenbosch Shiraz grapes ensures that the wine shows heightened layers of blackberries, boysenberries, figs, and plums, followed by notes of cocoa, chocolate, and coffee. It subtly shows the trademark black pepper note common to all Syrah and Shiraz. Two-stage oak treatment, using French and Hungarian oaks, contributes vanilla and toast while harmonizing the many flavors within the wine. A subtle hint of mineral remains in the background then accompanies the fruit through the long finish. This 18 liter kit makes 6 gallons (30 bottles) of wine. All of the ingredients you will need are included in the kit and are pre-measured along with fool-proof directions.ABOUT CELLAR CRAFT SHOWCASE: Many of these wine kits stand apart from our other offerings and have been deemed worthy of Showcase designation. Their distinction may come from breakthrough technology, such as exclusive Crushed Grape Packs; unique regional wines or any wine which we believe reflects a new level of excellence or discovery for the wine hobbyist. The level of excellence may require extra processing steps and, while designed to be bottle-ready in as little as 6 weeks, may require lengthier cellaring time to show at their peak.SPECIAL SAVINGS: Order 2 or more juices in any brand, any combination, at the same time and receive a 10% discount on both of them!

5497,"Yeast Nutrient","
Yeast Nutrients assist the wine yeasts in producing a complete and rapid fermentation. It is recommended for use in all fermentations. Yeast Nutrient provides a singular source of nitrogen for the yeast to utilize during the fermentation process. Nitrogen is typically found to be naturally lacking in most wine musts. Insufficient levels of nitrogen usually result in a sluggish fermentation and can also lead to the production of unwanted fusel oils, which can be detected as off-flavors in a finished wine. Out yeast nutrient is sold in 6 ounce jars for freshness. Each is sufficient for treating between 35 and 70 gallons of wine must, depending on the dosage.
Directions: Add Yeast Nutrient prior to fermentation by stirring directly into the juice or must until completely dissolved.
Dosage: For heavier bodied wines add &frac12; teaspoon per gallon. For lighter-bodied wines add 1 teaspoon per gallon. Yeast Nutrient can always be added later to wine for stuck fermentation as needed.
Maximum Dosage: Total dosage should not exceed 1-1/2 teaspoon per each gallon of wine.
Ingredients: Di-Ammonium phosphate (CAS 7783-28-0) (Formula: NH4-2HP04)

5523,"Pectic Enzyme"," Pectic Enzyme (ENZ110) is recommended for all fresh fruit wines. Add the Pectic Enzyme to the juice prior to the fermentation process in order to enhance the clarification process. The Pectic Enzyme destroys haze-causing pectin cells that can leave a wine with a permanent milky appearance known as a &ldquo;pectin haze&rdquo;. You can also add Pectic Enzyme to crushed fruit to increase the extraction of body and color from the pulp during the primary fermentation and pressing. All fruits have pectin and it&rsquo;s the milky gel that holds a fruit&rsquo;s fiber together, trapping the fruit&rsquo;s character within. This is why we recommend using Pectic Enzyme any time you are dealing with fresh fruits. This Pectic Enzyme will allow the character of the fruit to be extracted into the wine. This comes in liquid form and with complete directions (see below). Each 1-ounce bottle is sufficient for treating 45 gallons of wine. Directions: Use 1/8 teaspoon of Pectic Enzyme for every gallon of juice/pulp at the beginning of fermentation. Twice the amount may be needed if it is added later in the process. Ingredients: Pectinase (CAS 9032-75-1), sorbitol (CAS 98201-93-5), glycerine (CAS 8013-25-0) and sodium benzoate (CAS 65-85-0) ","in stock",New,8.5,eckraus.com/pectic-enzyme/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5523/images/6363/ENZ110LG_1__14181.1478552091.500.750.JPG?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:56+00:00,,0.13,,,,,,0,1
5524,"CO2 Manifold: 3 Outlet"," A CO2 manifold or distributor allows you to have one CO2 tank with multiple kegs.  This particular manifold gives you the ability to have three kegs on one CO2 tank.  A manifold can act as a gas line splitter with both home brew draft systems and commercial kegerators.  A single beer line can be turned off individually without interrupting the flow to other kegs.  These individual shut-offs give you the ability to swap-out or fix kegs without depressurizing your entire kegging system.  Each beer line also has a check valve that stops the beer from flowing backwards.  This eliminates the chance of beer accidentally flowing from one keg to other.  Check valves also keep beer from contaminating your gas lines and from backing up into your CO2 regulator.  All the gas lines attach to this CO2 manifold by sliding them onto the 3/8"" barbed stems. Then clamping them down.   A 3/8"" barb makes a nice tight fit for standard 5/16"" I.D. gas line.  Keep your draft system nice and tidy. The CO2 Manifold has screw holes so it can be mounted to a wall if you'd like.  You can also connect more than one of these CO2 manifold systems together by replacing the end cap with a pip union.  As your drafts system grows, your manifold system can grow along with it.  The CO2 manifold, itself, is made of extruded aluminum.  The ball-valve shut-offs and check valve are made of chrome-plated solid brass. The levers are rubberized.  The manifold inlet and end cap are made solid brass.  Dimensions: 7-7/8"" long, 3-3/8"" tall and 1-3/4"" deep.  SPECIAL NOTE: A CO2 manifold cannot deliver more than one pressure at a time. This is because the manifold is working off the same CO2 regulator. If you need more than one dispensing pressure, this can be accomplished with our Triple Gauge Regulator (Item: DF-RG330).","in stock",New,46.45,eckraus.com/co2-manifold-3-outlet/,https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ucycv5vmkf/products/5524/images/6583/df-mn130lg__59001.1478552096.500.750.jpg?c=2,Unknown,product.html,,,,,,,,,0,2016-11-07T20:53:56+00:00,,1.07,,,,,,0,1
5525,"Economy: Nitrogen Regulator / Double Gauge","   The dual gauges allow the regulator to display the pressure in both the keg and the Nitrogen Tank.      This comes in very handy by allowing you to monitor when your Nitrogen tank is getting low on gas.      This Nitrogen regulator model has an outlet for distribution to a single keg or canister.      Outlet has a instant shut-off lever to prevent back-flow from your kegs when changing tanks.      The shut-off is equipped with 5/16"" barbed stem for securely attaching your gas line to the regulator.      This unit also has a pressure relief valve that blows off excess pressure when 55 to 65 PSI is reached.      This Nitrogen regulator can be adjusted from a pressure of 0 to 60 PSI with the simple turn of a screw.      The keg dial gauge reads from 0 to 60 PSI. The Nitrogen tank dial gauge reads 0 to 2000 PSI.      Comes with a nylon washer for securing the seal between the regulator and the tank.

You may also detect some carmel-like flavors, but expect a dry finish, regardless. There is also a hint of fruity aroma. This is a result of the beer yeast working hard to produce alcohol levels higher than normal. The hops are barely noticeable, but are present. All-in-all, this beer is sipper, so it's best to have that mindset when drinking.

5564,"Crystal Dark 77L: Crisp Malt / 1 lb.","[GN252] Crisp Crystal Dark 77L is a medium-dark crystal malt. It imparts a rich, caramel-sweet flavor with hints of raisin and burnt sugar. It contributes a deep reddish-gold color. Crystal malts also add body and improve head retention. Use wherever its characteristic affect is desired. It is suitable for use in all styles of beer. Careful usage is required for lighter beers. Crystal malts are gently cooked during the malting process. Cooking initiates the enzymatic conversion of starches into fermentable sugars, and caramelizes some of the sugars as the malt reaches its final color. This eliminates the need to mash crystal malt, and ensures that some of the sugars will survive fermentation to sweeten the beer. &nbsp;   Grain Type: Crystal/Carmel Malt Approximate Lovibond: 72.0 - 82.0 EBC 190 - 217 Usage Rate up to 20% Origin: England  &nbsp; Special Savings:&nbsp;Buy 10 or more bags of malt - any type, any brand - and save 10% on them.

5572,"Winery-Grade Floor-Corker","   The quality of this floor-corker is quite exceptional, and at a deceptively low price.      It's perfect for corking larger volumes of wine: 10, 50, 100 gallons is not no match for this corker. It works swiftly and quickly.      This floor-corker is engineered in a way that allows you to easily insert wine corks up to size #9.      Just drop the cork into the chamber. As you pull the lever down a compressing iris begins to compress the diameter of the cork evenly from all directions.      This method of compression allows the cork to be inserted without getting mangled or disfigured.      Once you pull the handle all the way down, the cork is plunged into the barrel opening of the wine bottle with a ramrod attached to the bottom of the lever. This is all done in one smooth, even action.      The wine bottle sits on a spring-loaded table.      Just push down on the table with the bottom of the wine bottle to snap it into place.      Once you begin to pull the lever down, the spring-loaded table locks into place. This secures the wine bottle making it ready for corking.      Just pop the wine bottle into place; drop the cork in the chamber; pull down on the lever; and your done! It's that simple.      This floor-corker can accommodate bottles as short as 9.50 inches high and as tall as 14.25 inches.      In general, this means the corker has sufficient clearance to handle almost all 375ml, 750ml, 1 Liter, 1.5 Liter wine bottles.      The ramrod that plunges the cork is adjustable. This allows you to control how far into the wine bottle the cork is being inserted.      The compressing iris is made of Delrin, an advanced material that is extremely durable and creates less friction and wear than many metals, including brass.      Ships fully-assembled, except for back leg crossbar.      Height: (with lever down) 30.50 inches.      Height: (with lever up) 45.50 inches.      Leg Width: 19.00 inches.

5578,"CO2 Manifold: 2 Outlet"," A CO2 manifold or distributor allows you to have one CO2 tank with multiple kegs.  This particular manifold gives you the ability to have two kegs on one CO2 tank.  A manifold can act as a gas line splitter with both home brew draft systems and commercial kegerators.   Either beer line can be turned off individually without interrupting the flow to other keg.  These individual shut-offs give you the ability to swap-out or fix kegs without depressurizing your entire kegging system.  Each beer line also has a check valve that stops the beer from flowing backwards.  This eliminates the chance of beer accidentally flowing from one keg to other.  Check valves also keep beer from contaminating your gas lines and from backing up into your CO2 regulator.  All the gas lines attach to this CO2 manifold by sliding them onto the 3/8"" barbed stems. Then clamping them down.   A 3/8"" barb makes a nice tight fit for standard 5/16"" I.D. gas line.  Keep your draft system nice and tidy. The CO2 Manifold has screw holes so it can be mounted to a wall if you'd like.  You can also connect more than one of these CO2 manifold systems together by replacing the end cap with a pip union.  As your drafts system grows, your manifold system can grow along with it.  The CO2 manifold, itself, is made of extruded aluminum.

5600,"Winemakers Quick Starter"," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: A special mix of 13 different foods and nutrients. Designed specifically for pre-starting any liquid or dried wine yeast. Pre-starting the wine yeast allows the fermentation to start much sooner and at a more accelerated pace. It also allows for a sounder, more thorough fermentation. That means less chance of introducing a contaminant to your wine because of a stalled fermentation. The result is a more stable, cleaner tasting wine that will ferment to its highest alcohol potential. DIRECTIONS:1. For every 5 to 10 gallons of must, boil 3 level tablespoons of Quick Starter with 1 cup of water in a sauce pan for 5 minutes.2. Allow the mixture to cool to below 80 degrees F. while covered.3. Add the cooled mixture into a sterile wine bottle or similar.4. Pour in the appropriate amount of dried or liquid wine yeast. Place a cotton ball in the neck of the bottle or affix an air-lock.5. Keep in a warm place, preferably between 72-78 degrees F.6. The best time to add the starter to your must is just after activity level has peaked. This is usually between 6 to 24 hours for dried yeast and 2 to 4 days for liquid yeast.EACH 4 OUNCE JAR: is sufficient for making three yeast starters.INGREDIENTS: Dextrose (CAS 8030-23-7), malt powder, diammonium phosphate (CAS 7783-28-0), soy albumen, citric acid (CAS 77-92-9), gelitinized barley, gelitinized maize, malic acid (CAS 6915-15-7), tartaric acid (CAS 87-69-4), magnisium sulfate (CAS 7487-88-9), thiamin hydrochloride (CAS 67-03-8), ascorbic acid (CAS 50-81-7), tricalcium phosphate (CAS 1306-06-5).

5601,Ghostex," ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: GhosteX can be used in both wine and beer. It increases fermentation activity by aiding in the yeast' growth rate. The result is a stronger, healthier fermentation, with a cleaner flavor. GhosteX also helps to eliminate side-effects that are sometimes associated with over-worked yeast. For example, hydrogen sulfide levels will be lower. Adding GhosteX to your fermentation will also increase the yeast`s ability to ferment in higher concentrations of alcohol.DIRECTIONS: Add GhosteX prior to fermentation by stirring directly into the must or wort until completely dissolved. When adding to a wine must, it is recommended that GhosteX be used in combination with either Yeast Nutrient or Yeast Energizer for best results.DOSAGE: Use 1 teaspoon of Ghostex per each gallon of wine or beer at the beginning of fermentation. EACH 3 OUNCE JAR: is sufficient for treating 30 gallons of wine or beer.INGREDIENTS: Yeast hulls (Contains no additives).

5617,"Marchisio: Crusher & De-Stemmer / Manual"," FREE SHIPPING to the 48 states and available all year round. (FP170) The Marchisio Crusher &amp; Destemmer is designed to process your grapes for optimum body and flavor. The rollers are set the proper distance apart for crushing the grapes with just the right amount of force. The grapes go through the crusher and then fall into the destemmer portion where over 90% of the stems are quickly removed automatically. The pulp comes out the bottom and the stems come out the side. The Marchisio Crusher &amp; Destemmer is easy to use and will process 2,200 pounds of grapes per hour with normal, manual cranking. Just dump whole clusters of grapes into the hopper and start cranking the wheel. There&rsquo;s no adjusting or set up needed. All you need to do is attach the hopper to the unit and start cranking. Clean up is a breeze also; just hose it down and your done! How does it work? The grape clusters are sent through the rollers by rotating paddles within the hopper. The crushed clusters then fall into an elongated trough. The trough has perforated holes that allow the pulp to go through but not the stems. Inside the trough is a series of paddles that spin at a high rate of speed. These paddles slap the pulp through the holes, while at the same time, forcing the stems out the end of the trough. Both the crusher and de-stemmer operate simultaneously with the single cranking of the wheel. Why is crushing and destemming important? Proper crushing and destemming is an important step in making stellar homemade wines from fresh grapes. Over-crush your grapes and the wine could end up excessively laced with bitter tannins. Under-crush your grapes and you could be wasting flavor. Likewise, failure to sufficiently destem your grapes can also lead to excessive tannins and a bitter outcome. The Marchisio Crusher &amp; Destemmer is a professional piece of at home winemaking equipment. It is manufactured by Marchisio S.p.A. of Italy and is a recognized world leader of winery equipment since 1950. Details: This crusher &amp; destemmer can handle 2,200 pounds of grapes per hour. It has a total height of 24-1/2&rdquo; and has a large 19-1/2&rdquo; by 36-1/2&rdquo; hopper with a smooth, enamel-coated surface. The two cross arms are 46&rdquo; long for suspending over open containers. This specific unit will also work with the Destemmer Catch Stand. This Marchisio Crusher &amp; Destemmer feature two oversized, aluminum rollers for minimizing resistance. Each roller is 3-3/4&rdquo; in diameter and 8-3/4&rdquo; long. The cranking wheel is 18&rdquo; in diameter, so you have maximum leverage and it also features high-ratio, chain driven gears. Color may vary from what is in the above picture.

5803,"Marchisio: Crusher & Destemmer / Motorized"," The crusher destemmers we have in stock now are the same model as pictured above, only the body is red with white and the hopper is stainless-steel. Yes, you get a stainless-steel hopper for the same price of a painted one. Great deal. Get them while they last. FREE SHIPPING to the 48 states. ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: [FP180] This motorized Marchisio Crusher &amp; Destemmer is designed to process your grapes for optimum body and flavor. The rollers are set the proper distance apart for crushing the grapes with just the right amount force. The grapes go through the crusher then fall into the destemmer portion where over 90% of the stems are removed automatically. The pulp comes out the bottom and the stems come out the side.SIMPLE TO USE: The Marchisio Crusher &amp; Destemmer will process 2,200 pounds of grapes per hour. Just dump the whole clusters of grapes into the hopper. There's no adjusting or setting up. All you need to do is attach the hopper to the unit and turn the motor on. Clean-up's a breeze as well. Just hose it down and your done.HOW THE DESTEMMER WORKS: The grape clusters are sent through the rollers by rotating paddles within the hopper. The crushed clusters then fall into an elongated trough. The trough has perforated holes that allow the pulp to go through but not the stems. Inside the trough is a series of paddles that spin at a high rate of speed. These paddles slap the pulp through the holes, while at the same time, auger the stems out the end of the trough. Both the crusher and de-stemmer operate simultaneously.WHY CRUSHING AND DESTEMMING IS IMPORTANT: Proper crushing and destemming is an important step to making stellar wines from fresh grapes. Over-crush your grapes and the wine could end up excessively laced with bitter tannins. Under-crush your grapes and you could be wasting flavor. Likewise, failure to sufficiently destem your grapes can also lead to excessive tannins and a bitter outcome.QUALITY CRAFTSMANSHIP: The Marchisio Crusher &amp; Destemmer is a professional piece of winemaking equipment.
